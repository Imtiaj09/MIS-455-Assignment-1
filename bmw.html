            <h1>The BMW name vanishes for a time</h1>
            <p>In August 1918, Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH became a stock corporation. But the end of the First World
                War brought a halt to the construction of aircraft engines, as the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany
                from building them. So BMW shifted its focus to railway brakes and built-in motors. This was so
                successful that the Berlin-based brakes company Knorr-Bremse AG took majority ownership of BMW in 1920,
                integrated the company and relocated to Munich. Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH as an independent company
                disappeared temporarily from the scene – albeit not for long. <a

            <p>All this means that BMW AG is the legal successor of BFW. The corporate headquarters and parent plant of
                the BMW Group are still located at the former BFW site in Milbertshofen, Munich to this day. And there’s
                something else the aircraft manufacturers bequeathed to BMW AG, too: BFW’s founding date of March 7,
                1916 is considered to be BMW’s official birthday.<a
