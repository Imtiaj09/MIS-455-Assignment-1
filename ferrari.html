            <h1>It started with Enzo Ferrari</h1>
            <p>Enzo Ferrari, a car enthusiast from Modena, Italy, worked for Alfa Romeo as a test driver and later
                founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929, which served as a testing ground for his ideas and
                innovations. Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo due to a disagreement over the direction of the company's
                racing department. Despite the success of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, which was sponsored by Alfa
                Romeo, Enzo felt that the company was not fully committed to racing and wanted to strike out on his own.

            <h1>From Aircraft to Vehicles</h1>
            <p>After the war, the demand for aircraft parts declined and Enzo Ferrari turned his attention to producing
                cars. In 1947, he founded Ferrari S.p.A and AAC was eventually merged into the new company. Focused on
                producing high-performance sports cars. Ferrari created its first road car, the 125 S, introduced in
                1947, based on a modified Fiat chassis and powered by a 1.5-liter V12 engine. It was followed by several
                other iconic models, such as the 250 GTO and the 275 GTB in the 50s and 60s. These cars combined
                racing-inspired performance with elegant design, quickly establishing Ferrari as a leader in the
                high-end sports car market. The Ferrari 250 GTO is one of the most valuable and sought-after classic
                cars in the world, with some examples selling for more than $50 million.<a
