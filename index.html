        <h2>The Legacy of Karl Benz and the Benz Patent-Motorwagen</h2>
        <p>In 1885, Karl Benz designed and built the first true automobile powered by an internal combustion engine.
          This vehicle, known as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, was a three-wheeled vehicle featuring a single-cylinder
          four-stroke engine. Benz received a patent for his vehicle on January 29, 1886, under the patent number DRP
          37435, often regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile.
