                    Gottlieb Daimler purchases a villa in Cannstatt (Taubenheimstrasse). He immediately sets about
                    upgrading the
                    greenhouse
                    on the property by adding an extension to create his own testing workshop. The refuge in the
                    Taubenheimstrasse is an ideal retreat for the close-knit partnership of Daimler and Maybach to
                    continue
                    their research. Daimler’s vision was to focus on petrol as the fuel used in engines being built into
                    all
                    conceivable types of vehicle – whether for land, sea or air operation. The crucial technology that
                    provides the solution is discovered by Maybach after poring over extensive research carried out by
                    an
                    Englishman named Watson in one of his patents. The patent suggests the possibility of using an
                    unregulated hot-tube ignition system, an essential prerequisite for attaining higher speeds without
                    needing lighter, more powerful engines. The first design developed in the Cannstatt testing workshop
                    by
                    the two engineers is an “engine featuring unregulated hot-tube ignition system” based on the
                    four-stroke
                    principle pioneered by Otto, and subsequently patented by Daimler (DRP 28022).<a

        <h3>How it all began 1901: The first Mercedes.</h3>

                     Gottlieb Daimler does not witness one
                    of the most outstanding designs Maybach produced for the joint company. The first Mercedes generates
                    great excitement at the “Nice Race Week” in March 1901. It is a powerful, lightweight vehicle with a
                    low centre of gravity and stands out from all previously built cars. The 35 hp Mercedes is an
                    independent automobile design. It signals the end for the carriages used in automobile
                    manufacturing. The development of this pioneering design, which is considered to the first modern
                    automobile, is not only attributed to the genius of Wilhelm Maybach, but also to the initiative of
                    Emil Jellinek.<a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/milestones/corporate-history/"
